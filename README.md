Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using a logistic regression model.
The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Model Training and Evaluation
The notebook includes the following steps for model training and evaluation:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Model Training: Training a logistic regression model.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using accuracy score.

Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is performed to enhance the model's performance using a grid search approach.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy score of 81% on the test set. Further tuning resulted in an improved ROC AUC score of approximately 0.87.
